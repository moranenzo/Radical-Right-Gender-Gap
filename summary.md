<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    This study explores the "Radical Right Gender Gap" (RRGG) in Europe, with a focus on voting behavior across gender lines for radical 
    right-wing parties in France, Germany, and Italy. The RRGG phenomenon describes the tendency for women to support radical right 
    parties less than men. This study uses data from the European Social Survey (ESS) to analyze whether this trend persists in Europe, 
    especially with the rise of female leadership in radical right parties (e.g., Marine Le Pen in France).
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The analysis was conducted using SAS and focused on several factors:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Age Grouping</strong>: Individuals were grouped by age to observe differences in support by generation.</li>
    <li><strong>Party Recoding</strong>: Political parties in each country were categorized to align with the ideological framework of the study.</li>
    <li><strong>Gender, Education, and Ethnicity Factors</strong>: The study cross-referenced gender, education levels, and ethnic minority status to understand their impacts on support for radical right-wing parties.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Analyses and Findings</h2>

<h3>1. Influence of Age on Voting Behavior</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: To analyze if younger or older age groups exhibit a stronger RRGG.</li>
    <li><strong>Findings</strong>: Younger women (ages 18-27) showed slightly more openness to voting for radical right parties compared to older women (50+), though the RRGG remained evident across all age groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Gender-Based Party Support in France</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: To evaluate if there is a gender difference in support for radical right parties (specifically the National Front).</li>
    <li><strong>Findings</strong>: Men demonstrated a higher tendency to vote for the National Front compared to women, supporting the RRGG hypothesis. Women also showed higher levels of abstention or support for centrist parties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Support for Radical Right Parties in Germany and Italy by Gender</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: To investigate if the RRGG observed in France is consistent in Germany and Italy.</li>
    <li><strong>Findings</strong>: Both Germany and Italy exhibited a similar gender gap, with men being more likely to support far-right parties. This gap was more pronounced in Germany than in Italy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Education Level of Radical Right Supporters in France</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: To determine if education level correlates with support for the National Front.</li>
    <li><strong>Findings</strong>: Lower education levels (e.g., primary school certification) correlated strongly with support for the National Front, consistent with previous studies on socioeconomic factors influencing radical right support.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Interest in Politics and Media Consumption</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: To assess if interest in politics or media consumption affects RRGG.</li>
    <li><strong>Findings</strong>: Women who showed less interest in politics were more likely to support radical right parties. Additionally, women with lower media consumption on politics were found to support radical right parties more than those with higher media engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualizations and Data Representations</h2>
<p>The following visualizations were generated to illustrate the analysis findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age and Gender Distribution of Votes</strong>: A bar chart showing voting patterns across age groups and gender.</li>
    <li><strong>Gender-Based Party Support Distribution</strong>: A pie chart depicting gender differences in support for radical right parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Education Level Distribution for National Front Voters</strong>: A pie chart displaying education levels among National Front supporters.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethnic Minority Support</strong>: A bar chart assessing the level of support for radical right parties among ethnic minority groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>These charts support the findings and provide clear, visual insight into the RRGG and its influencing factors.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    The study confirms that the Radical Right Gender Gap is still prevalent in Europe, with women generally less supportive of radical 
    right-wing parties compared to men. However, factors such as age, education level, and political interest also significantly affect 
    this trend. The findings underscore the complex interactions between gender and political ideology, especially in the context of 
    socioeconomic conditions and media influence.
